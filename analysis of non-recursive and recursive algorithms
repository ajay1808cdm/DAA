 Non-Recursive Algorithm (Iterative Approach)
def factorial_iterative(n):
    if n < 0:
        return None  # Factorial is not defined for negative numbers
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
n = 5
factorial_result = factorial_iterative(n)
print(f"Factorial of {n} (iterative): {factorial_result}")



 Recursive Algorithm

def factorial_recursive(n):
    if n < 0:
        return None  # Factorial is not defined for negative numbers
    if n == 0:
        return 1  # Base case
    return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1)
n = 5
factorial_result = factorial_recursive(n)
print(f"Factorial of {n} (recursive): {factorial_result}")
